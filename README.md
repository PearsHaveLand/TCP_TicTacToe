### About
This was a project for school. Using a TCP connection, the user runs `tttc.py` to connect to the server, `ttts.py`.

The purpose of this project was to practice maintaining a TCP connection between a client and server.

At the moment, this project has only basic functionality in that the user can connect to a server and play tic-tac-toe.

### How to Play
On the server-side, run:

```python ttts.py```

On the client-side, run:

```python tttc.py```

Type the server IP into the client-side when prompted, and play!
